# CLIP4Kids: Exploring AI Bias and Fairness with Multimodal Learning

CLIP4Kids is a versatile, web-based system created using the Python library Gradio. Accessible through standard web browsers, it features three interactive interfaces designed to offer students valuable insights into AI's capabilities and ethical considerations.

## Core Technology: CLIP-ViT-B32 Model

At the heart of CLIP4Kids is OpenAI's CLIP-ViT-B32 model. This model enables the encoding of inputs in text and image modalities, allowing the computation of cosine similarity vectors. This unique capability quantifies relationships between text and images, facilitating functions like classifications, comparisons, and the visualization of associations.

## Tinkerability at its Core

CLIP4Kids is desgined with tinkerability in mind, encouraging users to experiment and explore the system. Key features supporting this goal include:

1. **Immediate Feedback:** Users can quickly observe the results of their actions, fostering a responsive and interactive learning experience.
  
2. **Fluid Experimentation:** The platform supports fluid experimentation, making it easy for users to initiate exploration and engage in iterative experimentation by connecting, disconnecting, and reconnecting with their ideas.

## Scaffolded Learning Experience

Enhancing the learning journey, CLIP4Kids follows a scaffolded approach:

- **Interface 1:** Introduction to associations in AI, laying the foundation for understanding.
  
- **Interface 2:** Direct interaction with system associations using students' language, fostering engagement.
  
- **Interface 3:** Presentation of a fairness task, where students decide how to use a smart door lock, connecting AI bias to real-world scenarios.

CLIP4Kids provides a dynamic and user-friendly environment for students to comprehend AI concepts, promoting exploration and critical thinking.

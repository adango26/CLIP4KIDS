# CLIP4Kids: Fostering AI Literacy for Young Minds

## Key Features:

- **Interactive Learning:** Engage children aged 9-10 years and older in an interactive exploration of different AI concepts.
- **Direct Interaction:** CLIP4Kids allows students to interact with OpenAI's CLIP model, and supports them in identifying and questioning AI biases.
- **Inclusive Curriculum:** Grounded in , our curriculum connects AI biases to broader societal biases.

## About the Project:

CLIP4KIDS is a multimodal, web-based system that we built using the Python library Gradio and can be accessed from a web-browser. It contains three interactive interfaces designed to provide students insights into the capabilities and ethical implications of AI. At the core of each interface lies the CLIP-ViT-B32 model. By utilizing this model, CLIP4KIDS can encode inputs in text and image modalities and compute cosine similarity vectors, thereby quantifying the relationships between various inputs. For example, an image of a German Shepherd would have a greater cosine similarity in CLIP with a text input like ``a photo of a dog'' or ``a photo of an animal that woofs'' than it would with ``a photo of a cat'' or ``a photo of an animal that meows.''  Image and text vectors play a pivotal role in generating probabilities in CLIP, which in turn enable functions such as classifications, comparisons, and the visualization of associations. 

We developed CLIP4KIDS with tinkerability as one of our core design goals. Toward this, we added a couple of affordances for facilitating tinkering: (1) support for immediate feedback, allowing users to quickly observe the results of their actions, and (2) support for fluid experimentation, making it easy for users to initiate exploration and engage in iterative experimentation by connecting, disconnecting, and reconnecting with their ideas. 

We scaffolded the learning experience by (a) introducing students to associations in AI in Intereface 1; (b) allowing students to interact with the associations of the system directly using their own language in Interface 2; and (c) presenting students with a fairness task, wherein they decided how to use a smart door lock in Interface 3.
